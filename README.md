A very simple example Node.js app for demoing OpenShift

This is a simple application to help demonstrate some of the capabiltiies of Red Hat OpenShift. It doesn't do anything particularly clever, simply responding with a short note that includes the hostname of the Pod it is deployed into.

I am also using this repository to test the use of Webhooks behind the firewall using smee.io.
